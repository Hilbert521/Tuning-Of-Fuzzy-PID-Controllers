Tuning-Of-Fuzzy-PID-Controllers
===============================

Fuzzy controllers are nonlinear; it is more difficult to set the controller gains compared to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. This assignment proposes a design procedure and a tuning procedure that carries tuning rules from the PID domain over to fuzzy single-loop controllers. The idea is to start with a tuned, conventional PID controller, replace it with an equivalent linear fuzzy controller, make the fuzzy controller nonlinear, and eventually fine-tune the nonlinear fuzzy controller. This is relevant whenever a PID controller is possible or already implemented.
